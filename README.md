# RDR2-Tie-Your-Lasso
This mod allows you to hitch your lasso, along with the peds tied to it, to the surface your are standing on.  

### Download:
- Download ScripthookRDR2: http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/
- Download the mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/197

### Installation:
- Download and install AB's ScripthookRDR2 
- Make sure you have an asi loader, it usually comes along with Scripthook.
- Remove previous versions of the mod, if you have any installed. 
- Copy *TieYourLasso.asi* to the game's main installation folder.

### How to use:
- Use your lasso just as usual.
- Press the key ("Look Back" key) when on foot to hitch the lasso to the ground.
- Note: due to some glitches make sure you aim at your target well, especially right before the lasso hit it.
- After you hogtie a npc, get close to him and then you can attach him to the ground (without lassoing it). You're also able to give him a little push.
