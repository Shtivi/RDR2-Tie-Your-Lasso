### Download:

- Download the mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/197

### Installation:
- Download and install AB's ScripthookRDR2 
- Make sure you have an asi loader, it usually comes along with Scripthook.
- Remove previous versions of the mod, if you have any installed. 
- Copy *TieYourLasso.asi* to the game's main installation folder.

### How to use:
- Use your lasso just as usual.
- Press the key ("Look Back" key) when on foot to hitch the lasso to the ground.
- After you hogtie a npc, get close to him and then you can attach him to the ground (without lassoing it). You're also able to give him a little push.
- It's also possible to attach the ped you carry to the ground.
- After attaching a ped to the ground, you can wind the rope by standing near it and pressing E or unwinding it by pressing R.
- Hang peds by hogting them and stand under a bridge or a tree. Then press V. Try to keep the player's front area clear because there the rope will be hitched so you can control it.
